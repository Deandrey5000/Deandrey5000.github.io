    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This ePortfolio integrates the acquired knowledge and skills developed throughout the academic years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). I have been in the computer science program since August 2018. Throughout the program, I have consistently been practicing my coding and programming skills to demonstrate my ability to code securely by adopting SEI CERT secure coding standards to ensure applications software is safeguarded against vulnerabilities, errors, and bugs. Over the years, I developed coding best practices to ensure codes are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Moreover, I expanded my skill set to become proficient in diverse programming languages. This ePortfolio is designed to demonstrate my background and give an overview of what I accomplished throughout the SNHU Computer Science Program. Furthermore, it illustrated the skills and concepts learned in various languages to develop software that adheres to the coding standards to eliminate security risks and vulnerabilities..</p>

    <p>While in the Computer Science Program, I have learned to understand C/C++ structure and algorithms, SQL and NoSQL databases, SEI CERT secure coding standards to mitigate security vulnerabilities, design and develop apps with Android, and collaboration to improve team productivity. Moreover, I learned about agile methodology and the software development life cycle and workflow, which primarily focused on flexibility, fast pace, and continuous improvement to deliver the best quality product possible. These learning experiences will be pragmatic and put into actionable steps to develop software securely. In the future, the knowledge acquired will allow me to build better apps, software, tools, databases, and websites that will offer consumers an improved user experience.
     During my years studying Computer Science at SNHU, I grew tremendously in the program, from having any programming experience to gaining the knowledge to develop high-quality outcomes and design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. Moreover, I learn to use collaborative tools and employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. 
    I started in the Computer Science Program in August 2018 as a part-time student, having studied in the program for as long as five years. Before enrolling in the program, I studied Computer Networking, but I did not complete the program. During those years, I have learned and improved my coding skills, debugging, and troubleshooting block of code that terminates program execution abruptly because of logical errors. Since I am fascinated with understanding how computers work, Computer Science/Software engineering is the perfect program to understand what’s going on in the front-end and back-end of a computer system. 
    While in the computer Science Program, I have gained the skills, knowledge, and abilities to code in diverse programming languages, which is important to have the flexibility to work between languages, syntax, and semantics. Moreover, I developed a tester mindset and a security mindset to test and integrate application security into the software development life cycle as early as possible is an essential best practice to protect software from a security vulnerability that could lead to a security breach. In order words, “don’t leave security to the end” and test every iteration help to detect vulnerabilities and mitigate attacks as early as possible in the development process.
    The DevOps process and infrastructure related to code reviews and coding standards best practices. By integrating security measures into each step of the DevOps process and infrastructure, DevOps becomes an automated process for the integration of security at every phase of the software development lifecycle, from initial design through integration, testing, deployment, and software delivery. DevOps practices and Agile aim to reduce security flaws at the beginning of the development life cycle by performing security tests early and often. Similarly, The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) integrates application and infrastructure security processes and tools. It addresses security issues as they emerge before they introduce into production. By then, they are easier, faster, and less expensive to fix. Moreover, it enables "software, safer, sooner" by automating secure software delivery without slowing the software development cycle.
    Thinking with a security mindset and not leaving it to the end is a way to gain a "zero trust" approach that improves my coding skills. Combining code reviews and a security mindset has helped me to discover bugs from modifying branches and analyze a team member’s code by identifying bugs, logic errors, style, test cases, consistency, performance, and unreachable call from breaking the source code. However, code review can be tedious, but incorporating it into the development lifecycle can result in positive outcomes. This approach helps me to engage and deliver the best quality codes that adhere to code best practices.
    Throughout the program, I have learned to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. All these skills have improved during my years of study at SNHU. With that said, the program instills the necessary tools to follow my future endeavors. Because of that confidence, I am targeting to specialize in Software Engineering with the ability to develop, design, and create innovative application solutions to solve real-world problems and help clients and organization to deliver the product vision with the highest outcome. As a future developer, I enjoy working with computers to develop applications that focus primarily on flexibility, fast pace, and continuous improvement to deliver the best quality product possible. It is equally important to consider myself a future developer with strong analytical skills to solve problems by applying engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build application solutions for end users.</p>
    <a id="Portfolio-of-consideration" href="#content">Portfolio of Consideration.</a>
    <p>Throughout the program, I developed a Computer Science mindset and learned Computer Science fundamentals and its methods. The fundamental understanding of those methods and principles allows me to enhance applications I did not know I could comprehend. Each of the principles or courses has impacted and helped to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to secure a position in the Computer Science field.</p>

    <p>Utilizing an ePortfolio in terms of the benefits of self-promotion and marketing showcases one's competence development. It indicates a positive impact and provides valuable contributions to one's self-competence. It demonstrates one's performance as a process of action and results. Furthermore, it exhibits the self-condition performance of a potential employer and evaluates this condition of one's readiness to take over individual responsibilities. In this paper, I use the ePortfolio as a vehicle for formative assessment of my accomplishments by connecting my experiences and knowledge gained through my academic years and workplace performance.</p>
    <a id="Refinement Plan and Code Review:" href="#content">Refinement Plan and Code Review.</a>
    <p>As a Computer Science Professional, I understand that code reviews are an excellent approach to discovering bugs from modifying branches. This approach helps me to engage and deliver the best quality codes that adhere to code best practices. However, no matter how effective the coding process is. There will always be room for mistakes. To address these mistakes, I must understand comments are a technical way to help me to grow and make better coding decisions rather than hinder them. Therefore, I do not take the comments personally and integrate the techniques that make the codes more appealing. Also, these comments are a way to ensure I follow guidelines and best practices. When reviewing code, it is extremely important to write translucent comments that address specific issues to avoid misleading the development-based team on a wild goose chase. This way, I can easily pinpoint the problem and implement a fix that binds to the code standard.</p>

    <p>The dashboard development uses the Dash framework to interact with the Mongo database and to connect the client-side user interface to Mongo. The dashboard interactive module clue the frameworks to facilitate interaction between Mongo and Python. For the client-facing web application to interact with Mongo, several component libraries were imported to allow communication among the frameworks. In order words, understanding and exploring how the dash core, HTML components, and callbacks work to produce an efficient and straightforward coding structure are the components that demonstrate my skills and abilities to connect the dashboard AIP with Jupyter Notebook.</p>
