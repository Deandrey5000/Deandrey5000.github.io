    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This ePortfolio integrates the acquired knowledge and skills developed throughout the academic years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). I have been in the computer science program since August 2018. Throughout the program, I have consistently been practicing my coding and programming skills to demonstrate my ability to code securely by adopting SEI CERT secure coding standards to ensure applications software is safeguarded against vulnerabilities, errors, and bugs. Over the years, I developed coding best practices to ensure codes are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Moreover, I expanded my skill set to become proficient in diverse programming languages. This ePortfolio is designed to demonstrate my background and give an overview of what I accomplished throughout the SNHU Computer Science Program. Furthermore, it illustrated the skills and concepts learned in various languages to develop software that adheres to the coding standards to eliminate security risks and vulnerabilities..</p>

    <a id="Portfolio-of-consideration" href="#content">Portfolio of Consideration.</a>
    <p>Throughout the program, I developed a Computer Science mindset and learned Computer Science fundamentals and its methods. The fundamental understanding of those methods and principles allows me to enhance applications I did not know I could comprehend. Each of the principles or courses has impacted and helped to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to secure a position in the Computer Science field.</p>

    <p>Utilizing an ePortfolio in terms of the benefits of self-promotion and marketing showcases one's competence development. It indicates a positive impact and provides valuable contributions to one's self-competence. It demonstrates one's performance as a process of action and results. Furthermore, it exhibits the self-condition performance of a potential employer and evaluates this condition of one's readiness to take over individual responsibilities. In this paper, I use the ePortfolio as a vehicle for formative assessment of my accomplishments by connecting my experiences and knowledge gained through my academic years and workplace performance.</p>
    <a id="Refinement Plan and Code Review:" href="#content">Refinement Plan and Code Review.</a>
    <p>As a Computer Science Professional, I understand that code reviews are an excellent approach to discovering bugs from modifying branches. This approach helps me to engage and deliver the best quality codes that adhere to code best practices. However, no matter how effective the coding process is. There will always be room for mistakes. To address these mistakes, I must understand comments are a technical way to help me to grow and make better coding decisions rather than hinder them. Therefore, I do not take the comments personally and integrate the techniques that make the codes more appealing. Also, these comments are a way to ensure I follow guidelines and best practices. When reviewing code, it is extremely important to write translucent comments that address specific issues to avoid misleading the development-based team on a wild goose chase. This way, I can easily pinpoint the problem and implement a fix that binds to the code standard.</p>

    <p>This paragraph is a narrative that accompanies the artifact, which aligns with the category of software design and engineering. The enhancement of the artifact selected demonstrates my proficiency, knowledge, and skills in implementing techniques to complete a polished project and the ability to solve complex problems in the software development process. This paper explains why the selected artifact is chosen and demonstrates my ability to use collaborative tools and techniques to implement the project to solve logical problems and address security flaws and defects embedded in software design early in development. Thus far, the goal is to develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</p>

    <p>The artifact is a binary search tree that accommodates several methods, which manage the creation of a search tree, insertion of nodes, deletion of nodes, and searching and displaying specified nodes. The objective of the artifact was to allocate resources to an acceptable performance to ensure that the best possible performance was being achieved. Speaking of enhancing the artifact, I chose the selected artifact because an understanding of complex data structures and algorithms is extremely helpful in situations where it is necessary to complete a task in a short amount of time with efficiency and using fewer resources. Moreover, it is necessary when searching and sorting through data tables to analyze interesting instances and solve real-life problems that companies are faced with.</p>

    <a id="ADatabases:" href="#content">Databases.</a>
    <p>The dashboard development uses the Dash framework to interact with the Mongo database and to connect the client-side user interface to Mongo. The dashboard interactive module clue the frameworks to facilitate interaction between Mongo and Python. For the client-facing web application to interact with Mongo, several component libraries were imported to allow communication among the frameworks. In order words, understanding and exploring how the dash core, HTML components, and callbacks work to produce an efficient and straightforward coding structure are the components that demonstrate my skills and abilities to connect the dashboard AIP with Jupyter Notebook.</p>
