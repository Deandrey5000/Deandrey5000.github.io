[Journal: self-Introduction](CS-499/Journal1-1.docx)

I work as a Senior Manufacturing Engineering Technician for Bose Corporation. Before working for the company, I had planned to pursue a career in electrical Engineering, but with my work hours and schedule, I could not attend class in person. So, I decided to enroll in SNHU's online Computer Science Program concentrated on Software Engineering. Simply put, I started in the Computer Science Program in August 2018 as a part-time student, having studied in the program for as long as five years. Before enrolling in the program, I studied Computer Networking, but I did not complete the program. Since I am fascinated with understanding how computers work, Computer Science/Software engineering is the perfect program to understand what's going on behind the scenes of a computer. Consequently, I decided to enroll in the program simply because the idea of telling a machine to perform a task or to be more precise to write code in some language for an application to execute and follow each step to accomplish a goal is astonishing.

Throughout the Computer Science Program, I have learned valuable skills that position me to the top marketable career that significantly projected growth rate faster than all other occupations nationwide (Kathleen, 2023). These skills that I learned from the computer science program will be added to my portfolio to boost my chances of employment. When I reflect on my previous experience, I see where I can enhance these skills to apply to multiple industries. With that said, a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science opens doors to exciting and lucrative professional opportunities in software development, computer programming, software engineering, and database administration that make the investment worthwhile (Kathleen, 2023).
