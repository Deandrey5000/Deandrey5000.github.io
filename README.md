#### Overview
##### Self-reflection
I work as a Senior Manufacturing Engineering Technician for Bose Corporation. Before working for the company, I had planned to pursue a career in electrical Engineering, but with my work hours and schedule, I could not attend class in person. So, I decided to enroll in SNHU's online Computer Science Program concentrated on Software Engineering. Simply put, I started in the Computer Science Program in August 2018 as a part-time student, having studied in the program for as long as five years. Before enrolling in the program, I studied Computer Networking, but I did not complete the program. Since I am fascinated with understanding how computers work, Computer Science/Software engineering is the perfect program to understand what's going on behind the scenes of a computer. Consequently, I decided to enroll in the program simply because the idea of telling a machine to perform a task or to be more precise to write code in some language for an application to execute and follow each step to accomplish a goal is astonishing.
